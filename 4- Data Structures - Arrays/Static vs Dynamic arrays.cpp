// C++, arrays are static, meaning that they have a fixed size
int a[20] // This array has 20 elements
int b[5] = {1,2,3,4,5} // This array has 5 elements, filled with the values 1,2,3,4,5

// In order to add an element to the array, we need to create a new array with one more element

// JavaScript arrays are dynamic
