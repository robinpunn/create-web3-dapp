# Master the Coding Interview:Data Structures + Algorithms

### Big O
1. What is good code?
    - Good code is 1) readable and 2) scalabe
2. Big O and Scalability
    - How much does the algorithm/function slow down as the input increases?
    *Algorithmic efficiency: how many operations it needs in order to find the answer across different input sizes*
    - The less an algorithm slows down as input increases, the better
3. O(n)
    - O(n) --> Linear time ...Big O depends on the number of inputs (n)
    - The number of operations increaes lineraly with the number of inputs
    - Most common Big O notation
4. O(1)
    - O(1) --> Constant time ...as elements increase, operations stay the same
